##The Rest API Client task involves creating a Java application that interacts with a RESTful web service to fetch real-time weather data. Using Java's built-in `HttpClient`, the client sends an HTTP GET request to the Open-Meteo API, which returns a JSON response containing current weather conditions for a specific location. The response is parsed using the `org.json` library to extract and display key weather details such as temperature, wind speed, and timestamp. This task demonstrates practical implementation of HTTP communication, JSON parsing, and integration of third-party APIs in Java, making it a foundational exercise in modern web-based application development.
